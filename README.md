# ckanext-login-throttle

A CKAN extension that helps protect your portal from brute-force login attacks by **tracking failed login attempts** and **temporarily locking accounts or IPs** after too many failures.

The original code was taken as an base from [ckanext-security](https://github.com/data-govt-nz/ckanext-security).

Check the [documentation](https://datashades.github.io/ckanext-login-throttle/).

## Features

- üîí Tracks **unsuccessful login attempts** in **Redis**  
- üîë Lock based on **IP address** (default) or **username**  
- ‚è≥ **Temporary lockout** (default: 15 minutes) after too many failed attempts  
- üìß Sends **warning email** to the affected user when lockout occurs  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully configurable via CKAN config settings


## Requirements

If your extension works across different versions you can add the following table:

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 2.10+           | not tested    |
| 2.11.3            | tested    |

Suggested values:

* "yes"
* "not tested" - I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't work
* "not yet" - there is an intention to get it working
